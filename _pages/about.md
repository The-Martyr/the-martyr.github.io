I'm The_Martyr, an undergraduate student interested in artificial intelligence. My current research interest is in multimodal large language models. Prior to this, I had an unforgettable research time at AIMlab, where I worked on problems related to action recognition and causal reasoning. I hope to learn from MLLMs, explore its bottlenecks, and explore the prototype of the next generation of intelligent systems. Welcome to email me to discuss!😄
